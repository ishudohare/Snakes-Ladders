This is a code implementation of Snakes and Ladders game in JAVA.

You can enter a custom number of Board game size.

You can enter a custom number of Snakes which are randomly allocated within the board.

You can enter a custom number of Ladders which are randomly allocated within the board.

You can enter a custom number of players, the names of which you'll have to enter, for checking the game progress.

The program comes to halt when the last player left reaches the end point.

This is  designed mainly on OOPS concept, can be taken as a Machine Coding Round practice for Big-Tech Companies.

I have used a 3rd party library(Lambok), to avoid writing too much boiler plate code thereby making the code visually clean.
